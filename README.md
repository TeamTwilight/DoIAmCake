# Do I Am Cake?
A Minecraft Modpack meant for The Official Twilight Forest Testing Server
https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/do-i-am-cake/

## About
As this pack is meant for a testing server, and specifically meant to test the [Twilight Forest Mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/the-twilight-forest), the goal is to keep it as light as possible. Minimal mods are to be included, most having some sort of compatibility with the Twilight Forest Mod with some exceptions.

All information about the server can be found over at the [Twilight Forest Discord Server](https://discord.gg/YfSMVtA) in the #server-information channel.

## Pack Updates
These generally happen when either:
 - Twilight Forest recently got an update and is in need of testing.
 - There's a major or annoying bug/crash/issue that needs attention.

Updates are usually slow, there wont be an update every time one of the mods in the pack are updated, rather mods get updated all in one batch.

## Suggestions
Yes, these are allowed, you may use the issue tracker for such.
### Add this Mod!
Sure, but first lets ask the following:
 - Why?
 - Is there any compatability or mod integration with Twilight Forest in this mod?
   - This isn't strictly necessary but it is preferred.
 - Is this a massive mod? Remember we wish to keep this a light pack!
### Remove this mod!
 - Provide good reason.
   - Perhaps there no longer exists compatibility with Twilight Forest?
   - Or maybe this is a very unstable mod, causing crashes and unstability which has become a nuisance.
### Change this config!
 - As usual, provide good reason
   - Does this improve gameplay with Twilight Forest?
   - Does it remain balanced?
   
Ultimately it's up to the pack developers to incorperate the suggestion, they have the final say regardless of reason.

## Where's X client side mod!?! (Minimaps as an example)
People have their own preferences of mods. It's easier for users to install their own favorite mods on their own instead of us forcing mods onto them. So with that we add little to no client side mods, exceptions to this are mods such as JEI.
